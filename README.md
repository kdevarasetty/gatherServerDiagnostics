# gatherServerDiagnostics
This script is useful for collecting mapr related logs like , mrconfig info threads, guts , cldb logs etc

you run gatherServerDiagnostics.sh to start collection, stopServerDiagnostics.sh to stop collection, packageServerDiagnostics.sh to zip up all the diagnostic files to one archive file, and cleanupServerDiagnostics.sh to delete all the diagnostic output files created by gatherServerDiagnostics.sh

The exact set of diagnostics gathered and the periodicity of collection is set in the gatherServerDiagnostics.sh script, adjust the values according to whatever metrics you want to collect as relevant to the issue you are working on.

The configurable fields are:

lightPollingInterval - Controls how many seconds between gathering samples of "light" metrics, e.g. ones that are trivial to gather and can be gathered as often as once a second without a risk of impacting the node where it is running
heavyPollingInterval - Controls how many seconds between gathering samples of "heavy" metrics, e.g. ones that requires non-trivial CPU/disk/memory usage to gather.  The amount required to gather one iteration of diagnostics is generally rather small, but gathering these every second can use an amount of system resources that can impact other running processes.  The effect shouldn't be severe but it is non-trivial.

gatherAllThreads - Gather OS level per-thread diagnostics for all threads running on the system
gatherCldbThreadsCpu - Gather OS level per-thread diagnostics for just threads in the CLDB process
gatherAllProcesses - Gather OS level per-process diagnostics for all processes running on the system
gatherHWResources - Gather system level hardware resource utilization statistics
gatherMfsThreadsCpu - Gather OS level per-thread diagnostics for just threads in the MFS process
gatherMrconfigThreads - Gather "mrconfig info threads" output 
gatherMfsRpcBindings - Gather "mrconfig rpc listbindings" output
gatherMfsRpcTraces - Enable MFS RPC debug logging while the script runs (generates a large amount of logging and can impact the system)
gatherGuts - Gather MFS guts output with all counters shown
gatherCldbStacks - Use "kill -3" against the CLDB PID periodically, stacks go to the CLDB stderr stream, usually cldb.log
gatherCldbPid - Periodically record the content of the cldb.pid file and whether there is CLDB running with that process ID
gatherNetstatPan - Gather the output of "netstat -pan" periodically
gatherNetstatPanForMapR - Gather the output of "netstat -pan" but only save info for TCP connections to the MFS or CLDB processes
